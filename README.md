# **CAVers**
- **SUMO-Veins based co-simulator**

## What is CAVers
- **CAVers** is an open-source platorm for **Connected Automated Vehicles(CAVs)**, by extending open-source enviroment SUMO and Veins, CAVers mainly focus on providing realistic vehicle dynamics, platooning analysis, V2V/V2I communications along with motion planning for commonly studied scenarios.
  
## Architecture
- The architecture of CAVers is shown in the following diagram, here, we divide this program into many layers (traffic generation, communication & perception, planning & behavior, control & dynamics, which is consistent with many current popular studies and has the potential to help researchers who only study part of the layers.

## Features
- SUMO based, enabling realistic vehicle dynamics and analysing platooning maneuvers

- Motion plannning senerios based on convertion of wiled-used datasets(HighD, InD, Round...)

- As the program is still under development, more features will be presented in future.
