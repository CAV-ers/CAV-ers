# **CAVers**
- **SUMO-Veins based co-simulator**

## What is CAVers
- **CAVers** is an open-source platorm for **Connected Automated Vehicles(CAVs)**, by extending open-source enviroment SUMO and Veins, CAVers mainly focus on providing realistic vehicle dynamics, platooning analysis, V2V/V2I communications along with motion planning for commonly studied scenarios.
  
## Sturcture

## Features
-SUMO based, enabling realistic vehicle dynamics and analysing platooning maneuvers
