# **CAVers**
- **SUMO-Veins based co-simulator**

## What is CAVers
- **CAVers** is an open-source platorm for **Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs)**, by extending open-source enviroment SUMO and Veins, CAVers mainly focus on providing realistic vehicle dynamics, platooning analysis, V2V/V2I communications along with motion planning for commonly studied scenarios.  

## Architecture
- The architecture of CAVers is shown in the following diagram, here, we divide this program into many layers (traffic generation, communication & perception, planning & behavior, control & dynamics), which is consistent with many current popular studies and has the potential to help researchers who only study part of the layers.

## Features
- SUMO based, enabling realistic vehicle dynamics and analysing platooning maneuvers

## Contact
- The program is mainly developed by Dr.Di Liu and Mr.Kang Yang, for any suggestions and further informations, please contact (liud923@126.com, kangyangedu@foxmail.com).
- As the program is still under development, more features will be presented in future.
